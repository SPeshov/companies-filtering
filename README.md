 Features

- Search for a company by typing into a search field. The search term gets matched only
against the company name and the list of companies is filtered based on the search term
in real time as the user is typing.

- Filter the list using a set of checkboxes to include only those companies which offer a
particular speciality (e.g. only Plumbing).
